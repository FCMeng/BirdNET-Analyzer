Creating your own species list
------------------------------

When editing your own species_list.txt file, make sure to copy species names from the labels file of each model.

You can find label files in the checkpoints folder, e.g., checkpoints/V2.4/BirdNET_GLOBAL_6K_V2.4_Labels.txt.

Species names need to consist of scientific name_common name to be valid.

You can generate a species list for a given location using :ref:`species.py <cli-species>`.
